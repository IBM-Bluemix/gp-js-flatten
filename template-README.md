Un/Flattener for jsonpath
=========================

Experimental adjunct to the
[Globalization Pipeline Node.js SDK](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/gp-js-client).

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/g11n-pipeline-flatten.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/g11n-pipeline-flatten)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/srl295/gp-js-flatten.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/srl295/gp-js-flatten)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/srl295/gp-js-flatten/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/srl295/gp-js-flatten)

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this utility is to flatten key/value pairs so that all keys and values are strings. Some types are ignored, such as empty right hand side values.

Also simple keys and values are by default left alone, so `{key: "value"}=flatten({key:"value"})`.
The `flattenAll: true` option will include these keys in the flattening.

News
----

In version 2.x, single quotes are used. This conforms with the Java client as well as jsonpath standards. See https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/gp-js-flatten/issues/18

Usage
-----

Given `input=`:

<code>
{{rawinclude 'test/input1.json'}}
</code>

and

```js
const flatten = require('g11n-pipeline-flatten');
const flat = flatten.flatten(input);
```

gives

<code>
{{rawinclude 'test/flatten1.json'}}
</code>

and then

```js
const expand = flatten.expand(flat);
```

gives


<code>
{{rawinclude 'test/expand1.json'}}
</code>

Using with the Globalization Pipeline
-------------------------------------

The flattener allows you to use deeply nested JSON structures with the [Globalization Pipeline Node.js SDK](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/gp-js-client), which service otherwise only supports flat key/value pairs.

See [./sample/SAMPLE-README.md](./sample/SAMPLE-README.md) for a full tutorial. The below gives a simple quickstart.

For example, you can “flatten” a JSON object before uploading to the Globalization Pipeline.

```js
const flattener = require('g11n-pipeline-flatten')
var gpClient = require('g11n-pipeline').getClient(…);
gpClient.bundle('mybundle').uploadStrings({
    languageId: 'en',
    strings: flattener.flatten(require('./en.json'));
}, …);
```

Conversely, you can then “expand” the results when downloading from it.

```js
const flattener = require('g11n-pipeline-flatten')
var gpClient = require('g11n-pipeline').getClient(…);
gpClient.bundle('mybundle').getStrings({
    languageId: 'en',
}, (err, result) => {
    …
    const expanded = flattener.expand(result.resourceStrings);
    // “expanded” is now the nested structure
});
```
